    "We worked with just one data set, the 2015 World Happiness Report, to explore data aggregation. However, it's very common in practice to work with more than one data set at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, you'll find that you need additional data to perform analysis or you'll find that you have the data, but need to pull it from multiple sources. In this lesson, we'll learn a couple of different techniques for combining data using pandas to easily handle situations like these.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use what we learned in the last lesson to analyze the 2015, 2016, and 2017 World Happiness Reports. Specifically, we'll look to answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Did world happiness increase, decrease, or stay about the same from 2015 to 2017?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, these reports assign each country a happiness score based on a poll question that asks respondents to rank their life on a scale of 0 - 10, so \"world happiness\" refers to this definition specifically."
